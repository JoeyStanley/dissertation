\chapter{Colophon}

This dissertation was typeset in {\LaTeX} using a stylesheet by Kyle Krafka. The references were formatted according to the Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics Journals using the BibLaTeX implementation produced by the journal \textit{Semantics and Pragmatics}. After writing the bulk of the contents in Microsoft Word, I switched over to {\LaTeX} two months before submission; the majority of this transfer was done while binge-watching \textit{The Office} and \textit{Cheers}.

%Specifics about the packages and layout I used.
